Developed a Streamlit-based web application enabling users to upload PDFs and ask questions based on their content. Utilized Google Generative AI and Langchain to extract, process, and chunk text, storing embeddings in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search. The application generates accurate, context-aware answers using a conversational AI model, facilitating interactive document analysis.
